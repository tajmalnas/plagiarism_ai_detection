https://grapevine.in/post/is-indias-startup-culture-harming-work-life-balance-6a1bb37e-d9fe-4084-961a-f16f159b2261,"I can say that the startup culture in India is too toxic and is definitely impacting work-life balance, and not always in a good way. I asked this question because I've seen both sides of the coin and wanted to share my perspective. On one hand, the energy and innovation in the startup ecosystem are absolutely electrifying. There's a sense of purpose and urgency that you don't often find in more traditional workplaces. But this comes at a cost. The long hours, the constant pressure to perform, and the expectation to be available around the clock can be overwhelming. I've seen colleagues burn out, relationships strain, and health deteriorate because of the relentless pace. In my own experience, I've had days where I barely saw my family, missed out on social events, and even neglected my own well-being just to meet deadlines or push a product out the door. The hustle culture is glorified to the point where taking a break feels like a weakness. It's almost like if you're not working 12-14 hours a day, you're not contributing enough. But it's not all bad imo. There are startups that are trying to change this narrative by promoting a healthier work-life balance, offering flexible hours, and encouraging employees to take time off. However, these are still in the minority. The prevailing mindset is still very much ""work hard, play hard,"" but the ""play"" part often gets sidelined. So, in my opinion, while the startup culture in India is driving incredible innovation and growth, it's also creating an environment where work-life balance is often sacrificed. It's a double-edged sword, and finding that balance is something that both employers and employees need to work on actively. Take the damn day off man! ""Hey, My cousins are here for a trip. I will be working remotely tomorrow. Thanks."" Better ""I will be taking leave"" Next day: hi you're fired First learn to request or demand a leave, then go about lecturing people on startups and culture. I wonder what work can ever be done on a WFH day while traveling tourist hotspots that also happens to be a bday trip. 😂😂😂 Startups or otherwise -  when you work,you work. When you're on leave, you delegate. You don't go half-assing about WFH for a bday trip in the mountains. Absolute dumbfuckery and stupidest post ever. Lol that's a bit harsh. I agree it should just be a leave, but still itna harsh... Now I am scared, next year from July I will be on probation for 3 months and will have my convocation in that time I wish I get it off July tho bahut door ki baat hai.... No need to be scared if you're planning to let your manager know within the week of joining. You'll lose quite a bit of trust if you tell them a couple of days before the convocation though don't read the message just send India's startup culture is too toxic, and I say this from personal experience. I've been part of the startup ecosystem for a few years now, and while it's exciting and full of opportunities, it's also incredibly demanding. The pressure t...

https://qz.com/india/1222311/the-dark-underbelly-of-indias-glamourous-startup-ecosystem,"Cersei Lannister. That’s what her team calls the 33-year-old co-founder of a Bengaluru-based startup behind her back. The Game of Thrones reference—Lannister is a cutthroat empress in the series—came about last year after she sacked a newly-hired marketing head on the spot following a difference of opinion during a meeting. The manager had joined the five-year-old startup with much pomp, having spent over 15 years at multiple big multi-national companies (MNCs). The firing was not a first at the startup, though, according to at least two current employees and a former one who spoke to Quartz of the firm’s many dictatorial policies. At another Bengaluru-based business-to-consumer startup, employees have been prohibited from using the table tennis equipment during office hours. The founder felt the staff was spending way too much time playing. ”We can use it post-9pm only. Who’s going to stay back so late in the night to play?” an employee asked, requesting anonymity. “Now the table just stands in a corner gathering dust. When outsiders visit the office, they look at it and think we have a great culture in the office. But we know the reality.” Indeed, behind the gloss and glamour of India’s booming startup ecosystem lies such an ugly truth: From unrealistic expectations, job insecurity, and constantly shifting goal posts to a lack of scope for growth, the reality of working at an Indian startup is far from fun. With young companies now increasingly pivoting their businesses or bringing in investors who suggest significant changes, employees are the ones left unsettled the most. Starting off on a quest for great ideas, the sector is now all about execution, revenue, and profit—and work culture is taking a backseat. “Chaos is what defines a startup,” said Vidur Gupta, director of staffing firm Spectrum Talent Management. With the euphoria of the initial years waning and reality sinking in of late, it has become harder for young companies across the globe to raise funds. Investors are stressing on revenue generation and profitability like never before, and startups are under pressure to make money more than anything else. So entrepreneurs have shifted from risk-taking innovations to sales. “India has been a startup hub for some years now and products are now out in the market. Now, the startup has to show market share and delivery. That’s what the promoters’ ask has been,” said Mayur Saraswat, head of sales at staffing firm TeamLease Services. This shift has not gone down too well with employees, who joined with hopes of a back-slapping, dress-code free informal ambiance. “It’s a sweatshop in there. You are not allowed to take tea breaks for more than 10 minutes,” a former employee of the Bengaluru firm mentioned above said, requesting anonymity. “If you take a third tea break in a day, ‘Cersei ‘ will pass a nasty comment in front of everyone. The co-founders sometimes even stand next to employees’ desks just to hear their conversations and check what windows are open on their computers.” Past and present employees of other startups, too, lament similar restrictions and work cultures. The often inexperienced entrepreneurs have failed to create a culture in their teams. And with these teams growing, this has become a very prominent problem. At least 10 startup employees from across the country described their experience to Quartz as “chaotic” and “messy.” They felt stifled at work and were desperate for alternative opportunities, preferably at a traditional MNC. “I have sworn to never work with another startup,” a 33-year-old marketing professional who quit another Bengaluru firm due to “a hostile work environment,” told Quartz. “I have been sitting at home for the last five months and looking for jobs with bigger companies. I could have easily found one at a startup by now. But I am more happy waiting it out rather than going back to that rut.” In small teams, most employees are expected to do jobs beyond what is specified on paper. This implies working extra hours and effort for the same salary. “The roles and responsibilities don’t get defined very well. The way performance is measured isn’t clearly defined,” said Aditya Narayan Mishra, CEO of Bengaluru-based human resources company CIEL HR Services. “Maybe an employee is a specialist and you try to make that person a generalist. It doesn’t work all the time” It is, of course, a given that entry-level professionals suffer under such circumstances. But even at the middle and top, though, serious hierarchical conflicts come into play. After all, the ecosystem has attracted hundreds of professionals from legacy industries like retail, consumer goods, insurance, and banking over the past decade. These professionals left behind cushy jobs, hoping to create instant wealth through stock options, seek more challenging roles, and to build solutions from the ground-up. But this shift itself has now become the premise of conflict. For instance, in smaller teams, the highly experienced professionals often have inexperienced bosses. And the seniors are often simply unable to adjust. “The disconnect is that a lot of these people who work in startups have previously worked with large multinationals (where) the processes are clearly defined,” said Gupta of Spectrum Talent Management. Whereas, in addition to an ambiguous work structure at startups, employees also have to handle multiple roles and stomach considerably higher pressure, he added. The tension also heightens when a founder’s passion is in conflict with a professional’s knowledge and experience.”There are some startups which are backed by big investors because of the power of the idea. But the management is not experienced,” said Mishra of CIEL HR Services. Such conflicts have already added to a serious attrition problem for Indian startups and may make it hard for the sector to attract talent in the future.

https://liveindia.tv/business/tears-in-the-workplace-indian-techie-reveals-toxic-culture-at-startup/,"December 22, 2024: Indian Techie Exposes Toxic Startup Culture: Long Hours, No Training, and Verbal AbuseA Redditor has opened up about the toxic work environment at an Indian startup, shedding light on long hours, lack of proper training, and a culture of verbal abuse. The post, which has since gained significant attention, reveals the harrowing experience of an employee who faced humiliation and was reduced to tears during a Google Meet session. Also Read: “UK Salaries Are a Joke”: UK Professor Says India Pays Better, Sparks Debate The employee accused one of the company’s co-founders, who also acts as the tech lead, of regular verbal abuse. The techie detailed how the mistreatment left him emotionally overwhelmed. “I cried on Google Meet in front of the tech lead. I do not know how to face it now,” the title of the post read. In his account, the Redditor explained that the startup environment required employees to endure 12-15-hour shifts without adequate guidance or training. During one particular meeting, when the employee pointed out the lack of clear instructions for a project, he was met with harsh words and humiliation. “I couldn’t hold my tears and started crying. I was not in the mental zone to work, so I told him I’m taking leave after a few hours,” he shared. Also Read: ‘Cursed’ Hollywood Mansion of Brittany Murphy and Britney Spears Returns to To Be Sold; Priced at $18M The Reddit post has garnered over 700 upvotes and numerous supportive comments. Users rallied around the techie, offering empathy and advice. Also Read: Tasteless Chai for ₹169? Singapore Envoy Calls Out Chayos; Internet Responds with Humour The post also sparked a discussion about the broader challenges within startup ecosystems in India, where employees often face exploitative work environments. One commenter suggested switching to established companies or freelancing to escape such toxic cultures. Community Support for the TechieThe Reddit community was quick to provide solace, urging the employee to prioritize mental health and find a healthier work environment. Many highlighted that such behavior from leadership often worsens over time and recommended leaving the company for a more respectful workplace. One veteran employer noted, “The day your manager disrespects you should be your last ‘mentally engaged’ day at that company. Respect and dignity are non-negotiable.” Broader ImplicationsThis incident has reignited conversations about work culture in Indian startups, with many urging for better regulations and accountability to protect employees’ well-being. Toxic work environments not only harm individual employees but also undermine the potential for innovation and growth within the organization.

                                       Reigning as one of the top cities for job opportunities driven by its booming IT sector and an influx of lakhs of youth every year, Hyderabad finds itself at the centre of entrepreneurial emergence. According to the Global Startup Ecosystem Index 2024, the city has over 650 startups, representing 6% of the country’s startups and is the 4th best startup ecosystem in the country. However, despite its widely-recognised reputation as a city that promotes and facilitates the establishment of new ventures cutting across fields as well as welcomes ambitious job seekers from across the country, young employees in the city report various structural issues such as job insecurity, excessive workload, unstable and dysfunctional work ethic, perfunctory grievance redressal systems and overall ‘toxicity’ prevailing over the workspace. Also watch: EY employee death: Do laws in India adequately protect the corporate workforce? Anshu Bhingradia (25), who worked as a Graphic Designer and 3D animator at an FMCG brand based in Banjara Hills says that he was sacked within four months of joining the company in 2023 and still has not been paid for the last month. “I had to use my own device for office work, which eventually broke down due to the heavy workload. It cost me a lakh to recover the data and repair my device without any assistance from the company. Despite all of this, I was laid off within four months for no specified reason. I have still not been given a month’s pay while working overtime almost every day. The company refuses to communicate and settle the matter,” he told The Hindu. Brane Enterprises, a tech startup in Hi-Tec City, which has links to Byrraju Ramalinga Raju, the main accused in the Satyam Computers scandal and lists his son Byrraju Rama Raju and other family members as shareholders, recently laid off more than 1,500 employees and has not cleared salaries up to 4 months. “I joined the company on May 6 this year and was laid off within 4 months on August 3. My salary of 3.5 months along with the full and final settlement, which amounts to 5 lakhs is still pending. There are cases of other employees from the company running in labour courts and civil courts at present, but there seems to be no hope of recovering our deserved salaries. We have withheld the company laptops to acquire our relieving letters at least,” says a former employee of the company requesting anonymity, who relocated from Kolkata to Hyderabad in search of a job after completing his post-graduation. “I was not aware that the company had Ramalinga Raju serving as a ‘mentor’ prior to joining, I saw this as an opportunity for me to kickstart my career in tech in Hyderabad. I fear that the owners have powerful links and will retaliate severely if I attempt to lodge a complaint,” he added. While long and strenuous work hours, sporadic hiring and firing, and freezing of salaries in emerging companies are oft-overlooked and whitewashed as ‘hustle culture’, employees also highlight the lack of grievance redressal systems in startups. “I personally experienced and saw various other women colleagues routinely tolerating body shaming, mocking, and derogatory remarks at a fashion startup based in Jubilee Hills. A male manager used to unabashedly comment on my weight and physical appearance and invade my personal space,” said 25-year-old Sindhu Vaishnavi, who was compelled to leave the job within 3 months of joining. Under the POSH Act, 2013, every organisation with 10 or more employees must establish an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) to tackle complaints of sexual harassment and institute redressal policies. “I complained to the HR and senior manager but they did not take any action. There was no regulatory body where I could lodge a complaint. This culture is so pervasive across fashion startups that reform is a faraway fantasy. It is not only detrimental to one’s mental wellbeing but compels young girls with big dreams to exit the industry moments after stepping into it,” she highlights. Similarly, Piyali Chakraborty of Nallakunta, who resigned from an ed-tech startup within 2 months of her tenure, highlights the extent of verbal and emotional abuse an employee faces for voicing their concerns and demanding reform.  “I had to arrive by 8:30 a.m. with work stretching until 10 p.m.. The office lacked proper seating, air conditioning, and basic amenities like a cafeteria or refrigerator. Shockingly, we didn’t even have computers; all tasks were done manually. Strict rules prohibited communication with other departments, and raising any concerns was met with verbal abuse from the Secretary, which created a sense of fear among the employees,” she told The Hindu. “When I decided to leave, the company denied returning my original documents which they had taken from me as ‘security’ during my recruitment. I was forced to take up extra work in exchange for my documents and had to forfeit a month’s salary,” she added. The recent death of a 26-year-old Chartered Accountant Anna Sebastian Perayil, who worked at Ernst & Young (EY) in Pune, allegedly owing to extreme work pressure, has brought to the forefront conversations about fostering healthier work cultures. Upon being asked about long-term solutions to the prevailing work culture across the city, Anita Rego, a Hyderabad-based psychiatric social worker observes: “Victim blaming can become counterproductive and result in job resignations and increased employee health concerns. There is a tendency to shift the narrative onto the individual who is under stress. Workplace toxicity is an organisational issue and thus, the systemic issues at the organisation need to be resolved.” Ms. Rego, who is the curator of a two-year programme called ‘Tuning into Empathetic Leadership’, supporting a group of production companies to reduce bullying, harassment and grievances at the workplace, emphasises that healthier workplaces and happier manpower contribute to better productivity and profits, while urging companies to initiate employee support programmes.

 Karimganj Polytechnic Date Written: feb 3, 2022 The surge of venturing into independent business set-up has climbed a notch higher in the last decade. The numbers are telling - from 3,100 startups in 2014 to a projection of more than 11,500 by 2022, this is certainly not a passing trend. It’s a revolution. And it’s going to change the way the markets are working today in India. India, thereby inevitably proves to be a popular eco-system for any start-up to find its prominence. Although the success rate of startups has always dimmed low in India. Reasons’ being plenty, the most commonly repeated mistake is the unapologetic nature of Indian young entrepreneurs trying to adopt or rather imitate the business culture or corporate culture prevalent in the western nations. Now the failure rate of the startups has much to do with the strategy and decisions incorporated by the founder or the CEOs of the company.There are many organizational theories as to what a start-up should refer before starting its operations. 80% of its compliance depends upon its founder, which can be supposedly established among its first 20 employees. But things start getting diverse when there are more than 50 employees in a start-up.

     Dear Readers, Startups are often hailed as the engines of innovation and economic growth, but beneath the glamour lies a pressing issue: many Indian startups struggle to sustain a healthy workplace culture. This newsletter delves into the reasons behind this challenge, supported by detailed statistics and insights. India is home to over 84,000 registered startups as of 2023, with the ecosystem valued at over $450 billion. However, cultural challenges within these startups paint a stark picture: 70% of employees in Indian startups report experiencing burnout, according to a 2022 Nasscom survey. 55% feel a lack of career development opportunities, highlighting a gap in long-term growth planning. 45% cite poor work-life balance as a significant issue, as revealed by an EY study on workplace dynamics. Only 30% of startup employees feel their organizations provide adequate mental health support, according to a survey by LinkedIn India. Startups often prioritize rapid scaling and revenue generation, sidelining employee well-being. A McKinsey report found that 85% of Indian startups prioritize market capture over organizational health, leading to overworked teams. Founders, often young and first-time entrepreneurs, lack managerial expertise. A KPMG study noted that 60% of startup leaders have no prior experience managing teams, resulting in poor communication and unclear expectations. HR functions are often underfunded or underdeveloped. 42% of startups have no formal grievance redressal mechanisms, according to a Deloitte survey. Unrealistic KPIs foster internal competition rather than collaboration. A Harvard Business Review article highlights that 63% of Indian startup employees feel undervalued in their roles, contributing to dissatisfaction. Compensation packages often emphasize stock options over competitive salaries. 48% of employees feel financially insecure, as per a PwC report, citing delayed ROI on equity-based pay. The average attrition rate in Indian startups is 30-40%, compared to the global average of 20%. A 2023 report by TeamLease Services found that 57% of employees leave within two years, citing burnout and lack of growth. Disengaged employees cost companies 34% of their salary in lost productivity, according to Gallup. Startups with low employee satisfaction see up to a 25% dip in productivity, as per an Assocham study. Poor reviews on platforms like Glassdoor deter top talent. 78% of prospective employees check online reviews, and 40% decline offers due to negative feedback, according to a survey by Indeed. Invest in training founders and managers in people management and emotional intelligence. Companies that prioritize leadership training see a 15% increase in employee retention, as per a study by Korn Ferry. Implement mental health programs, flexible working hours, and initiatives to prevent burnout. Organizations with robust well-being programs report a 21% increase in employee satisfaction, according to the World Economic Forum. Encourage open dialogue about challenges and achievements to build trust. Transparency can reduce turnover by 18%, as shown in a Glassdoor report. Develop robust policies for career growth, grievance handling, and workplace ethics. Startups with strong HR policies experience a 32% lower attrition rate, as per Deloitte.

       Estimated reading time: 3 minutes India has the third-largest startup ecosystem in the world, with over 60,000 startups and 65 unicorns (those that reach US$ 1 billion in valuation) in multiple industries. However, 90 per cent of these enterprises are likely to fail within the first five years, which makes it a difficult market to break into. Vipin Sreekumar, Priya Rachel David, and Palash Deb discuss the hidden pitfalls of the Indian startup market.   The pandemic has accelerated digital adoption by organisations worldwide, easing the flow of cross-border investments as investors can now quickly access information on foreign startups and their operating environments. As if in sync, overheated western markets, dominated by legacy investors such as Tiger Global, Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital, are sending startup deal valuations through the roof (The Economist, 2021). Many global investors are therefore exploring the large and booming startup markets in emerging economies, particularly China and India. While much has been written about the many advantages of the Chinese startup scenario, the Indian startup scene appears equally promising, and needs deeper exploration. India has the third-largest startup ecosystem globally, with over 60,000 startups across its 642 districts. As of April 2022, India is home to as many as 65 unicorns across multiple industries, with money pouring in from major foreign investors (Table 1; Figures 1 and 2). Table 1. Number of unicorns by country  Source: CB Insights Global Unicorn List (as of 6 April 2022) Figure 1. Indian unicorns by industry (percentage)  Source: CB Insights Global Unicorn List (as of 6 April 2022) Figure 2. Number of Indian unicorns funded by major foreign investors  Source: CB Insights Global Unicorn List (as of 6 April 2022) But despite the optimism surrounding Indian startups, it is estimated that 90 per cent of them are likely to fail within the first five years. Global investors must therefore look for hidden pitfalls before they take the plunge. Indian entrepreneurs differ from their western counterparts in how they view the world. For instance, the former are more reluctant to share information and take longer to trust outsiders (Harriss, 2003). There have also been cases of early-stage Indian startups splurging investors’ money (Rajagopalan and Zhang, 2008). This is in stark contrast to western countries where tighter socio-ethical norms motivate entrepreneurs to treat investors’ money perforce as their own. The recent allegations of financial impropriety against the founders of BharatPe, an Indian fintech startup, is a case in point. Besides, given the emphasis on close-knit family ties in Indian society (Warner, 2014), it is common for Indian startups to have family members in key leadership roles. Replacing them is never easy, implying that conflicts over governance issues may potentially arise in future if the Indian founding family is reluctant to cede any control even to investors with significant ownership stakes. With a population of 1.4 billion, including a ‘middle class’ of around 600 million, India is said to have huge market potential. But this can be deceptive, given the much smaller de facto size of the Indian market. Take consumer technology, for example. According to a 2020 report by the Internet and Mobile Association of India, there are 622 million active internet users in India, but most of them possess only basic smartphones that lack processing speed and memory. Moreover, the absolute purchasing power of the Indian middle class is considerably lower than the middle class in developed economies (The Economist, 2018). Many Indian customers also distrust online transactions (Sahney et al., 2013), making it harder for geographically distant startups to attract these customers who often rely on traditional neighbourhood stores that accept cash payments. The Indian consumer is also highly price-sensitive (Mukherjee et al., 2012), making customer retention an ongoing challenge, and leading to cash burn in the form of discounts and deals. Contrary to popular belief, it is not the lack of regulation that hurts Indian businesses, but over-regulation, which results in opaque administrative processes (India Economic Survey, 2021). Under-implementation, the flip side of over-regulation, is another common regulatory malady. Startups, in general, often create markets that are beyond the scope of the existing regulatory landscape (e.g., the lack of comprehensive regulations for self-driving vehicles), and this problem is worse in India. Indian startups also have to deal with regulatory flip-flops (The Economist, 2020). For instance, the recent revocation of the auto-payment feature for recurring payments by the Indian central bank caused major disruptions to payment wallets and other subscription-based startup models. What further muddies the water is that India is not one large, homogeneous market, but rather a collection of several micro-markets divided not only along the lines of state-specific regulations, but also by income levels, regional economic development, and cultural norms. These create a labyrinth of legal and other associated complexities that startups must navigate in order to thrive (David et al., 2021). By and large, foreign investors have shown a preference for investing in startups founded by the alumni of the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) (Table 2) and/or the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) (Table 3), the Indian Ivy League universities (Nigam et al., 2020). However, viewing academic pedigree as a proxy for entrepreneurial ability can lead to poor investment decisions. Investors need to look beyond academic degrees while evaluating entrepreneurs, and discern more relevant signals such as social capital, technological competence, founding team experience, startup alliances, patent applications, access to government grants, or even affiliations with third parties or other venture capitalists (Colombo, 2021). Partnering with local incubators and accelerators can also be a good way for foreign investors to test the Indian startup waters. Table 2. Number of Indian unicorn founders who are IIT alumni  Source: Adapted from the Hurun India Future Unicorn List 2021 and Tracxn Table 3.

Total VC exits value in India ($B)  Note: The Walmart-Flipkart deal contributed approximately 80% ($16B) to 2018’s exit value. Source: Bain India Venture Capital Report 2021. In the initial euphoria of investing in a promising startup, foreign investors must not forget to keep an exit door ajar. Exit can be tricky in the Indian market (Dominic and Gopalaswamy, 2019; Figure 3). Big-ticket acquisitions of startups, such as Walmart’s $16 billion acquisition of Flipkart in 2018, are rare. Most acquisitions do not result in high-value deals, with many startups “marked to myth” rather than to market (The Economist, 2020). Pulling off a successful IPO is no easy feat either (Figure 4). Despite the spate of IPOs in 2021 (examples include digital payment giant Paytm, food delivery company Zomato and the cosmetic e-tailer Nykaa) and the relaxation of norms by SEBI (India’s capital market regulator), the number of startups going public is still quite low when compared to the US or China. That is because the Indian capital market is still relatively underdeveloped, with a somewhat lukewarm participation by retail investors (Giannetti and Koskinen, 2010). Post successful listing, the market prices of many newly listed stocks often witness a sharp decline, causing retail investors to question their massive valuations. This has forced many startups to reconsider their IPO plans, making it even harder for investors to find a profitable exit. Figure 4.

But despite the optimism, running a successful startup in India remains a daunting challenge. Foreign investors, in particular, must understand how and where they can go wrong when investing in India. ♣♣♣ Vipin Sreekumar is a PhD candidate in Strategic Management at the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta.

I think in the next few decades India will be one of the economic hubs of the world. Interesting article. However, some of your facts are outdated and quoted totally out of context or any frame of reference. Your headline grab:  “However, 90 per cent of these enterprises are likely to fail within the first five years, which makes it a difficult market to break into.” – this refers to an IBM Institute for Business Value whitepaper, which in-turn refers to a blog on NDTV.com that is dated March 2017 – your article is dated May 2022!!  The entire relevance of your article is questionable – since the very premise seems faulty. Further, apart from the one reference to the IBM whitepaper, there is really nothing in your article that goes to support your headline grab that “90% of Indian startups will fail within 5 years!”  Let’s take a look at some FACTS. – In 2017, there were about 4,000 startups in India (in total) – https://www.statista.com/statistics/691887/number-startups-in-india-by-vertical/ – If one were to assume that the NDTV Blog, IBM Whitepaper, and your blog were true, then the Indian startup ecosystem should be practically dead! Instead you now have 66,000 + startups in India (2022 data).  – You report statistics are with a 2020 outer range, despite the fact that you write this article in 2022!! The COVID impact has in fact triggered the rise of startups in India, and this trend is only going to increase in the years to come. Funding scenarios WILL undergo ups and downs – that’s normal with any economic cycle in any country. India is not unique to this. The Ukraine war has stalled a lot of initiatives across geographies, industries and companies (in various stages of growth and existence). But this is a blip in the larger scheme of things. Not a barometer by which you can set forth an opinion.  – Your conclusion leaves me mystified! “But despite the optimism, running a successful startup in India remains a daunting challenge. Foreign investors, in particular, must understand how and where they can go wrong when investing in India.” – what is the basis of this opinion?  Nothing in your article goes to contribute to this conclusion with any specific reference to India.  – IPO’s failing is due to the forced exits that PE’s need – to showcase returns to their Limited Partners. I can’t think of a single sane Founder who wants to exit at the detriment of the investing public. By the time the startup gets to the stage of an IPO, the founders are highly diluted – the only real beneficiaries are the PEs. And SEBI norms with regard to a track record of profitability has vanished – leaving the doors open for loss making startups to launch an IPO.  Anyways, I think I have made my point. This is a highly respectable blog space of LSE, and I would reckon that a little more caution, a little more diligence is the norm rather than the exception. Cheers,

Just four months into her career, Anna's life ended tragically. Her mother, Anita Augustine, attributed ""work stress"" as a major factor in this heartbreaking loss. In a heartfelt email to EY’s India chief, Rajiv Memani, Anita shared her daughter’s journey. This dedicated individual performed exceptionally well in her studies but ultimately became overwhelmed by the relentless demands of her position. She expressed her concerns, stating that “placing such excessive burdens on new employees is completely unjustifiable,” and called for a significant transformation in how organisations support their staff.  Anna’s situation is not merely a personal loss; it reflects a broader, systemic issue that is prevalent in India, a country known for its demanding work culture. According to the International Labour Organisation, Indian workers clock an average of 46.7 hours per week, with over half (51%) working 49 hours or more. This concerning data positions India as the second-highest country in terms of long working hours, only behind Bhutan, where a staggering 61% of workers exceed the 49-hour limit. Such statistics should act as a wake-up call for businesses to reconsider their work environments. The challenge of excessive working hours is not limited to India. Other countries, including the United Arab Emirates (50.9 hours) and Lesotho (50.4 hours), report similarly high averages. However, India’s predicament is particularly alarming due to the large proportion of its workforce exceeding the 49-hour threshold.  Conversely, nations like Aruba and Germany maintain average working hours between 34.2 and 46.1, achieving a healthier work-life balance for their employees.  Vanuatu is a notable example, averaging just 24.7 hours per week, with only 4% of its workforce surpassing the 49-hour mark. This approach to work-life balance sharply contrasts with the significant pressures faced by employees in India and Bhutan, where over half the workforce is frequently overworked. The troubling figures regarding working hours in India call for immediate action. Anna’s heart-wrenching experience serves as a critical reminder for organisations to reevaluate and reform their work cultures. Emphasising long hours not only threatens employee health but also undermines overall efficiency. To prevent further tragedies, companies must prioritise mental well-being. Here are essential strategies they can implement: Allow employees to create their own schedules, enabling them to manage both professional responsibilities and personal lives better. Implementing mandatory breaks throughout the workday can rejuvenate employees, enhance creativity, and improve performance. Providing access to counselling and mental health support is vital for employees experiencing stress and burnout. Creating an environment where mental health discussions are welcomed can foster a supportive workplace. Organisations should promote transparent communication, allowing employees to voice concerns about their workloads without fear of repercussions. Clearly defining roles and setting manageable workloads can help ensure that employees do not feel overwhelmed by relentless demands.  The tragic story of Anna Sebastian Perayil serves as a compelling call for corporate cultures to evolve. The time for change is now. As India faces the realities of overwork, companies must take proactive steps to protect the mental health and well-being of their employees. By embracing strategies that promote a healthier work-life balance, organisations can enhance employee satisfaction and foster a sustainable, thriving workforce.  1 2 Why DeepSeek is a Big Deal: The AI Disruptor Taking on OpenAI and Tech Titans 3 China Creates World's First Artificial Sun, Achieves 100 Million Celsius in Fusion Breakthrough 4 How a 1998 Meeting with Steve Jobs Birthed Wi-Fi Technology 5 Steve Jobs’ Advice: Turn Setbacks into Opportunities Like Fishermen Do The CapTable HerStory Social Story Enterprise Story The Decrypting Story YS Life YS Hindi YS Tamil practo microsoft ola swiggy zomato uber delhivery amazon cred nykaa Glossary Everything AI How-to’s knowledge base Opinion DevSparks Pune SheSparks List Your Startup Startup Spotlight Pitch To Us Browse Startups Start your day with impactful startup stories and concise news!

     India is one of the fastest-growing startup ecosystems in the world, but it's not without its flaws. While numerous success stories have come out of India's startup scene, several issues need to be addressed if Indian startups are to truly reach their full potential. In this blog post, I'll take a look at some of the most common problems facing India's startup ecosystem and discuss how entrepreneurs can address them.   In the Indian startup ecosystem, there is a lack of risk-taking. This is because the ecosystem is too focused on copycats and me-too startups. There is a need for more originality and innovation in the ecosystem. There are several reasons for this lack of risk-taking. One reason is that the ecosystem is too focused on short-term gains. Startups are often looking for quick wins instead of long-term sustainability. This leads to a lot of copycat and me-too startups, as they are the ones that can achieve quick wins. Another reason for this lack of risk-taking is that there is a lack of funding for early-stage startups. This means that startups have to be more conservative in their approach as they cannot afford to take risks. Lastly, the Indian startup ecosystem is still relatively young and immature. This means that there is a lack of experience and expertise in taking risks and making bold moves. Startups need to be more cautious as they navigate the waters. Innovative thinking is the key to success for any startup. Indian startups, however, seem to be lacking in this area. There are many reasons for this, such as the lack of a culture of taking risks and failing, the fact that copycat ideas are more popular than original ones, and the difficulty of finding and hiring top talent. Without new ideas, it will be hard for Indian startups to compete with those around the world. They will also find it hard to attract investors and customers. To succeed, Indian startups need to start thinking outside the box and come up with new and original ideas. India has long been known as a country of imitators, not innovators. This is reflected in the startup ecosystem, where too many companies are focused on copying successful foreign models instead of developing their original ideas. This reliance on copycats is stifling innovation and stopping the country from developing its own unique startup culture. It also means that many startups are competing for the same small pool of customers, which drives up costs and makes it difficult to find funding. The Indian government has attempted to encourage more innovation by setting up incubators and funding programs, but these have not been very successful so far. If India wants to build a thriving startup ecosystem, it needs to start promoting originality and encouraging entrepreneurs to take more risks. Since the late 1990s, the Indian government has put in place several policies meant to encourage the growth of startups in India. But many experts think that these policies have not worked to make India a good place for startups to grow.  One major problem is that the Indian government has been slow to adapt its policies to the ever-changing startup landscape. For example, the government's tax incentives for startups are not well-suited for today's fast-growing startups, which are often pre-revenue and may not have profits for several years. Another issue is that many of the Indian government's initiatives have been top-down, rather than bottom-up. For example, the government has started a number of incubators and accelerators, but it hasn't done enough to support local projects or create a place where innovation can thrive. Finally, there is a lack of coordination between different government agencies working on startup policy, which has led to duplication of effort and confusion among entrepreneurs. The most important problem is that the quality of education is very poor. There are not enough good teachers, and the classrooms are often overcrowded. In addition, there is a lot of pressure on students to do well in school, which can lead to cheating and cheating. Finally, the cost of education is very high, which makes it difficult for many families to send their children to school. The startup ecosystem in India is plagued by infrastructural issues. Poor infrastructure is one of the major impediments to the growth of startups in India. Startups often have to contend with power cuts, water shortages, and bad roads. These problems are compounded by the fact that most startups are located in Tier-II and Tier-III cities, where infrastructure is even worse. In addition to these problems with basic infrastructure, there is also a lack of good office space and places for startups to grow. This forces many startups to operate out of dingy basements and cramped co-working spaces. There is also a lack of funding and guidance, both of which are important for a startup to succeed. The Indian startup ecosystem is a complex one, with many different issues that can affect its success or failure. From the lack of funding and infrastructure to the difficulty of finding skilled workers and managing regulations and policies, it's clear that there are significant challenges ahead. But if these problems are fixed in time, Indian startups might be able to reach their full potential and become successful around the world. India's startup ecosystem will grow quickly with the right help from investors, good policy reform, better infrastructure, and access to talent pools.

The first half of 2024 saw nearly 10,000 employees being laid off in Indian startups, according to data from Longhouse Consulting.   This was an improvement from the 15,000 layoffs in the second half of 2023, which followed the 23,000 layoffs in the first half of the same year. India’s economic conditions remain favourable, with an estimated growth rate of 9.7% in Q1 2024-25, but does a startup job and its perks offset the high-volatile environment? HR experts seem unanimous in their response.   “At an ecosystem level, we have gone through the worst of it already,” says PhonePe’s Chief People Officer Manmeet Sandhu. An HR expert with more than 20 years of experience, Sandhu was speaking on YourStory’s new podcast, The Mass Effect. In the first episode, hosted by Shivani Muthanna, Director, Content at YourStory, Sandhu spoke about the state of affairs in startup hiring and work culture in India with Kartik Narayan, CEO of Staffing from TeamLease; Kamal Karanth, Co-founder at Xpheno; and Ashish Kumar Singh, Chief HR Officer at Meesho.   In the last couple of years, Indian startups have shown a preference for freshers or young professionals. Data by foundit (formerly Monster) reveals that from April 2023 to 2024, 53% of all job openings in startups were inviting freshers. The data also revealed that IT services led the share of available jobs in startups, with Bengaluru the top city for such jobs. This shift was not necessarily led by people from IITs or IIMs, but those who demonstrated problem-solving skills alongside teamwork and communication, the HR experts said. According to Xpheno’s Karanth, startup jobs have become an aspirational parameter for youngsters. The number of people who worked in tech jobs in startups had doubled to 5 lakh in the post-vaccination hiring boom as compared to before the pandemic. Despite the job cuts and people leaving, the number of people working in startups remained strong. While the number of tech jobs had reduced, Karanth says that the 190 companies his company tracked had hired close to 32,000 people in the past two years.   Startups may be a high-churn environment but remain at the top of the pyramid when it comes to job aspirations for techies. “Last year, we saw 8,000 people move from product companies to startups,” Karanth adds.  Startups were followed by the large FAANG companies (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google), which employ 1.4 million people in India, and Fortune 500 companies, GCCs, IT services firms. The bottom of the pyramid housed non-technology companies, including banks and PSUs.  Image courtesy: Xpheno Among the 1.4 lakh startups recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), 117 are unicorns as of December 2024.   The year 2024 was revolutionary for Indian startups: 12 companies launched their IPOs as compared to six in 2023, six in 2022, and 10 in 2021. Collectively, they raised more than $4 billion, including Swiggy’s $1.5 billion offering and more than $730 million by Ola Electric.   Many tech employees have turned startup founders, but there is now a “level of good sense” in how startups are being founded, Sandhu says.   “We went through a phase where everybody thought that they could be a startup founder.” This phase has “tempered”, and “that's a good thing, because now people are thinking about potential value-creating ideas where this could possibly translate into a long-term successful business. People are being a lot more sensible about that”, she says.   This tempering has also changed the way startups are looking at hiring.   According to TeamLease’s Narayan, (hiring) managers previously expected candidates to have functional experience. Now, there’s a greater acceptance of “fungibility” — that one could have different functional backgrounds but go into fields other than ones they had experience in, he says. He adds that an exception was when hiring at the senior level, where the conversation leaned more towards a risk appetite.  The experts say that startups have, in the past few years, moved from the idea of “growth at any cost” to being profitable. An employee’s contribution to build “zero to one” products meant their value was going up in the future, and this, coupled with the autonomy employees got with regard to innovation, are driving factors for working in a startup.  Early-stage funding for startups halved this year from its peak activity in 2021-2022, data from Tracxn reveals. While $3 billion early-stage funding was raised across 1,533 deals through November 2024, it was down from $4 billion spread across 2,137 deals in the same period last year. Did this have any effect on who startups were employing?   “One trait I definitely see in most startups is [that] you should have the ability to do a lot more things than just a defined job,” says Narayan, adding that an appetite for risk and ambiguity was also called for.   “One problem that happens [if one works] in large corporations [is], you don't figure out whether you are driving the train or riding the train. That shock comes the moment you enter a startup… [It's] a reality check, which happens with many people and then suddenly [they] realise, this is not for me,” Narayan says.   Startups bring forth the need to go beyond technical skills, showcase the ability to articulate oneself, collaborate and work with others, and have good interpersonal communication skills.   Recruiters at Meesho are looking for people who are good at problem-solving and have a mission orientation, not necessarily people with expertise in a particular area, Singh says. “By and large, we are very comfortable putting people in an area that they have never worked in. It has worked for us because they bring very original thoughts and questions, which earlier somebody would not even ask,” he says, adding that first principles were highly important to the company.  At PhonePe, Sandhu looks for not just demographic diversity, but also thought and functional diversity while bringing people together across multiple functions and ensuring that there is an understanding of how the fundamentals work. This also included common frameworks that help them think about how far they could go with a problem.   Working in a startup is an equation of risk versus reward, the experts say.   The scope of hiring within startups has expanded beyond IITs and IIMs. This is not just because the problem pool has expanded, but also because democratisation has taken place, enabling people with different skill sets to solve various problems and found startups in different industries. Moreover, startups are also looking for people with resolve and a high agency to solve problems and get tasks done.   However, Karanth feels the skills gained from IITs and IIMs cannot be discounted, not because of the degree itself but the experience gained during the course.   “One reason pedigree and credentialing help is network and access to resources. A lot of early-stage companies might also fail because they do not have the right network to be able to access resources,” Narayan says.  With a large number of Zoomers entering the workforce, companies are adapting to different ways of working. Gen Z and startups seem similar as both have the ability to pivot easily, an advantage in the entrepreneurial ecosystem as compared to a large corporation.   Singh says the main thing Gen Z employees look for in a startup is flexibility. Their main purpose could be something outside of their job but they are whip smart about many things. “They know so many things so well, even at a very young age, [things] that people with a lot of experience sometimes don't catch.”   Gen Z has a need for a connection as they are lonely when compared to other generations, Sandhu says. But that isn’t a sufficient reason to work; they need deeper engagement.  Zoomers display an intensity towards being “obsessed” in solving a problem over consistency via a typical 9-5 job, Narayan says. They tend to be highly engaged in a given problem, but do not want boring routines. The Startup India initiative was announced in 2016, and according to DPIIT data, startups have created nearly 15.5 lakh direct jobs as of 2024, contributing to 10-15% to India’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth.   According to the Confederation of Indian Industry’s Unicorn 2.0 report released in April 2024, India’s startup ecosystem has the potential to add $1 trillion to the country’s economy by 2030, in addition to creating 50 million new jobs. Of these 50 million, 4-5 million were expected to be direct jobs, 9-10 million were in gig work, and 35-40 million would be indirect. The report added that startups created 20-25% of jobs in India over the last decade.  The podcast leans into how artificial intelligence will come into play in these new jobs. Other talking points include India’s hustle culture, which has led to toxicity in the workplace for many, how to deal with its repercussions, and red and green flags for hiring managers.

https://www.nexthireconsulting.com/post/pay-gap-between-startups-and-big-known-old-firms-in-india,"NextHire Home Employers Job Seekers About us Blog More Updated: Aug 24, 2023 When it comes to finding a job, most people aim to work for big known old firms as they offer job security, a well-established work culture, and a brand name that adds value to your resume. However, in recent years, the Indian startup ecosystem has grown significantly, and startups are not only offering innovative work opportunities but also are willing to pay their employees much higher salaries than the big known old firms. According to a recent report, the average salary of a startup employee in India is around Rs. 11 lakhs per annum, while the average salary of an employee in a big known old firm is around Rs. 9 lakhs per annum. This difference in pay is not only limited to the entry-level jobs but also applies to mid-level and senior-level roles as well. So, why are startups paying higher salaries? Startups in India are still in their early stages and face tough competition in attracting top talent. They need to offer their employees something that big known old firms cannot, such as a dynamic work environment, opportunities to work on new and innovative projects, and a higher degree of autonomy. But above all, startups are offering higher salaries to attract the best talent in the market. Moreover, startups understand that their employees are their biggest assets, and investing in them is crucial for their growth and success. They offer higher salaries to not only attract talent but also to retain them. Unlike big known old firms, startups have a limited budget and cannot offer huge bonuses, stock options, or other perks. So, they compensate for it by offering higher salaries to their employees. It's not just the technical roles that are seeing higher salaries in startups; even non-technical roles such as marketing, sales, and business development are also seeing a significant pay difference compared to big known old firms. In conclusion, the pay gap between startups and big known old firms in India is a reality, and it's growing. If you're looking for a job, it's essential to consider all options, including startups, as they not only offer higher salaries but also provide a more dynamic work environment and opportunities to work on new and innovative projects. However, it's crucial to note that working for a startup comes with its own set of challenges, such as job security, work culture, and uncertainty. So, it's essential to do your research and make an informed decision before taking up a job offer from a startup. In summary, while big known old firms offer job security and a well-established work culture, startups in India are now offering higher salaries and more dynamic work environments. As the startup ecosystem in India continues to grow, it's worth considering job opportunities with startups to see if it's the right fit for you. Will GPT4 replace recruiters?

https://t-hub.co/why-diversity-and-inclusivity-count-in-indias-startup-innovation-ecosystem/,"Why Diversity and Inclusivity Count in India’s Startup Innovation Ecosystem Srikanth Bolla set off on an entrepreneurial journey when he was refused permission to appear for the Indian Institute of Technology entrance exam. Although he excelled in academics and sports and scored 98 per cent in his 12th board examinations, Srikanth was discriminated against for one reason — his ‘visually impaired’ status. But this setback only spurred him on to scale greater heights. Hailing from an economically disadvantaged family in Andhra Pradesh, Srikanth earned the unique distinction of being the first visually impaired international student to win a scholarship from MIT for a Master’s program. Driven with a sense of purpose to help persons with disabilities like him to gain an equal foothold in the employment market, Srikanth returned to India to found Bollant Industries in Hyderabad. The company’s manufacturing facility produces eco-friendly biodegradable products, such as areca plates and dinnerware; disposable paper plates and cups; and natural leaf plates, among other consumer products. Today, Bollant Industries stands tall among competitors and has registered a turnover of Rs 150 crore in 2018. Srikanth’s story is a fitting example of how the innovation ecosystem abounds with meritorious workers who represent the entire spectrum of diversity — Persons with Disability (PwDs), women, the LGBTQ community and persons belonging to minority ethnic groups. Numerous studies have found that diversity and inclusion are critical to the workplace and have a positive impact on employee productivity and performance. Organisations that are proactive in this space can enhance brand perception and strategise for improved business outcomes. As business leaders around the world are playing by the right rules to make their organisations more diverse and inclusive, the winds of change are blowing within the Indian startup ecosystem, too. Inclusivity matters for diversity The majority of today’s startups understand that innovation can be delivered only when there is a cultural overhaul in organisations. Indian startups are on the cusp of this realisation and are showcasing their commitment to promoting diversity by employing people who may not be a part of the ‘mainstream’ workforce. Startups such as MakeMyTrip are championing the cause of people with disabilities by training and hiring them in various roles. The company runs a cafeteria that is sensitive to persons with disabilities and provides reconfigured workstations for them. In a progressive move, Youth4Jobs, a Hyderabad-based NGO partnered with the University of Hyderabad to host a two-day career fair for people with disabilities. JP Morgan supported the NGO, and the event had participation from global behemoths, such as Walmart, Dell, Google and Microsoft, among others. The Career Expo provided a platform for persons with disabilities to connect with prospective employers and gain insights into career guidance, skilling and other employability factors. In another notable step towards an inclusive workforce, India’s first technology accelerator focused on persons with disabilities, Assistive Technology Accelerator (ATA), was founded in 2018 to help assistive technology startups scale up. Under its aegis, ATA Enable — a 16-week-long acceleration program — was launched. The Hyderabad-based accelerator aims to empower persons with disabilities to leverage technology to scale their startups, receive mentorship and gain market access. Crucially, such ecosystem enablers help this stratum of the workforce to lead a life of self-respect and dignity. In 2017, on the occasion of International Day of Persons with Disabilities, the Telangana government had announced that it would be setting up the world’s first IT campus for persons with disabilities. The objective behind the initiative was to create employment opportunities for such individuals by providing training and world-class infrastructure. Thus, innovation is breaking new ground in the country through such radical initiatives from key stakeholders. Acting as agents of change, they are bringing in diverse communities to contribute to the workforce and boost the country’s GDP. A growing culture of workplace inclusivity is also seen among corporates that are openly supporting the LGBTQ community in hiring policies. For instance, IBM and Accenture help de-stigmatize the ‘queer’ experience within their organisations by encouraging employees from the LGBTQ community to express their feelings on social media. Some, like SAP Labs, are even hosting pride marches on campus. No diversity without woman power Since the term diversity also encompasses the gender make-up in organisations, the participation of women has become critical to the progress of the startup ecosystem. Women employees are entitled to certain privileges under the Maternity Benefit Act. The Act protects the interests of women both during pregnancy and after childbirth and includes benefits such as paid leave for new mothers, nursing breaks and the option to work from home. Establishments with more than fifty workers must provide for creches in their office space. Corporates and startups alike are also wooing female workers by taking it up a notch for new or prospective mothers. Intel India has launched Home to Office ortheH2Oinitiative that encourages women to return to the workforce after delivery. Also, PayPal in India launched its Recharge Program to put women technologists on a six-week “back to work” program post a career break. Zomato offers up to 26 weeks of paid leave and also provides $1,000 (Rs 71,719) per newborn child as an endowment to parents working with the company. Microsoft is one among many corporates that recognises non-traditional parents in its leave policy. Besides maternity leave, the tech giant also grants parental leave for new fathers, foster parents and adoptive parents. Changing lives through equal opportunity for all According to the 2011 Census, India is home to 2.68 crore persons with some form of disability or the other. However, while the trend across Indian startups and big businesses is to hire differently abled workers, the dismal reality tells another story. Studies show that persons with disability constitute only one per cent of the workforce in India. Although India is the third-largest startup hub in the world, according to NASSCOM, only 10 per cent of startup founders are women in the Indian IT industry. However, female entrepreneurs seem to be on a better wicket when it comes to venture capital funding. A recent study showed 22 per cent of women participated at Series A, Series B and growth stages of funding across Indian startups. In comparison, women’s participation in startups in the West stood at 26 per cent. Undoubtedly, more needs to be done by the Indian startup sector to promote diversity and inclusivity within their organisations. HR leaders should take cognisance of the huge untapped talent pool from persons with disabilities and move away from the hitherto narrow approach to hiring. Organisations also need to foster an inclusive environment that embraces a diverse workforce as only then is it possible to foster creativity and productivity across teams. In particular, small businesses should sensitise the mainstream workforce to the challenges faced by their colleagues with disabilities and promote team-bonding activities. Startups also need to invest in setting up a comfortable work environment attuned to the needs of persons with disabilities. For instance, wheelchair ramps should be built to access the office building, washrooms should be inclusive and flexible work options should be offered to such employees. Education and skill gaps among persons with disabilities often prevent them from getting hired. To address the paucity of talent in organisations, business leaders should provide adequate vocational training and upskilling to them. The government has also stepped up efforts to remove entrepreneurial barriers for persons with disabilities. For instance, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment offers various skill development opportunities and grants to PwDs. Also, Skill Council for persons with Disability (SCPwD) was set up to encourage participation from persons with disabilities in the national workforce. More such policy measures need to be in place for diverse groups, thereby fostering innovation through a diverse workforce. The globalisation of business has made it imperative for companies to attract and retain top talent. If organisations fail to prioritise diversity goals, they cannot drive innovation that aligns with business goals. Looking ahead, it is then evident that only socially responsible companies can hope to survive in the long run. Clearly, organisations that recognise the power of diversity and inclusivity are the ones that will also create the maximum social and business impact."
https://www.forbes.com/sites/ajayyadav/2016/08/18/how-startup-culture-in-india-differs-from-the-u-s/,"Pexels.com  India is quickly becoming a leading global startup hub. Rising numbers of entrepreneurs, incubators, international and local VCs, and multinational corporations are turbocharging the development of a burgeoning tech scene. In fact, the number of startups in India is expected to nearly quadruple from 3,100 in 2014 to over 11,500 by 2020. As an expat entrepreneur who moved to the U.S. from India, I have been able to benefit from each startup culture, applying the best of both styles to drive my company forward. My experience has recently come full circle, as my company gets ready to open its first office in India, following our roll-out across the U.S. and Canada. Here’s a look at some of the key differences in business styles, models, and approaches I’ve noticed along the way, and what they can teach us. To Fail or Not to Fail In America, failure is often seen as a natural stepping stone on the road to success. People may go to school to study one thing, take a job doing another, and then move around between companies and industries throughout their careers. The U.S. seems to celebrate comebacks as much as initial success. That’s not how I experienced failure growing up in India. In India, failure is frowned upon in every instance. When I failed a few times in my early education, the sense I got – and had to fight against – was that failure was the end of the road, not a bump in the road. This tendency has no doubt led to the demise of many promising careers for countless entrepreneurs – and perhaps stopped many from even daring to try in the first place. Given that the vast majority of startups fail, Indian business culture must begin to examine its tolerance for founders’ missteps – and encourage the knowledge gained from failure to be applied to future success. Show Me the Money In the U.S., startups can secure funding on the basis of a strong concept, often without revenue or a set business model. Companies have the opportunity to prove their value proposition and test products extensively before releasing them to market. In India, however, access to capital is more limited, causing startups to focus on monetization, revenue, and lean operations from the outset. Startups are usually funded only after they have a working product and a proven business model, with revenue. In other words, Indian investors are only going to give you money if you’ve already shown you can make money for them. But this methodology can result in missed opportunities – i.e., the learnings that benefit many American startups that are willing to sacrifice revenue in their early phases in order to focus on refining the product and gaining organic user growth. Without that cushion of funding, it’s also much tougher for Indian startups to pivot, leaving many companies to flounder. Company Building In the U.S., where competition for talent is often fierce, startups aim to recruit the best employees by offering perks and providing a great company culture. I’ve also experienced how the entrepreneurial spirit is widely valued for employees within the American startup culture, perhaps first famously embodied by 
Google
, which used “20% time” to encourage employees to pursue side projects in innovation. India, on the other hand, seems to be more of an employer’s market. For those companies with strong business models and adequate funding, talent is plentiful. Workers often forgo perks or recognition simply to hang on to their paychecks. The workplace culture can also tend toward micromanagement rather than employee autonomy, achieving results, but sacrificing some employee satisfaction due to the added pressure. As our company expands into the Indian market, I’ve made a conscious effort to take the best of both worlds, and match our existing culture – forged in the U.S. – with local norms. Is the Customer King? Businesses in the U.S. are renowned for creating a great customer experience – the idea being that loyalty and repeat business is cheaper than acquiring new clientele. India is also known for customer service, but in a different way: employees of outsourced call centers, often trained to implement standards prescribed by companies from other nations. When it comes to startups, however, Indian companies aren’t prioritizing how to delight customers and improve retention rates in the same way as their American counterparts. Recent studies suggest that Indian firms risk losing significant business due to lack of adequate customer service. There’s a tremendous opportunity for both startups and established companies to build and improve customer loyalty in India by adopting practices that are now considered standard within the U.S. He & She The U.S. has a long way to go in achieving gender equality in the business arena, but as this article points out, there has been a recent groundswell of support for female entrepreneurs. India lags behind in employment for women. According to a report by Genpact, women are still greatly outnumbered by men, comprising about 25% of the total workforce, with only 15% of companies having women on their boards. Some say that this is largely because traditional cultural norms encourage marriage and familial duties, rather than career and entrepreneurship. Just as the U.S. is making headway with gender equality, I’m optimistic that with the expansion of incredible organizations such as SheWorx and other online resources and support, greater female empowerment will arrive in India within a generation. India will need to take a sledgehammer to its glass ceiling if it truly wants to build out a world-class startup ecosystem. India’s Moment The U.S. has long benefited from being the world’s melting pot, attracting expats who carry business lessons from their native countries and apply them in America. But today, it’s an exciting time to be an entrepreneur in India. Resources for startups are growing, internet access is exploding, and educational initiatives for the startup community are expanding exponentially. Access to networks of mentors and advisors – which had been severely lacking – is becoming easier. As a result, many Indian entrepreneurs I’ve been advising have begun applying U.S. models in key areas such as culture and consumer relationships, in order to help their startups grow. Given the injection of international capital and knowledge support to the region, we will likely continue to see the stunning growth of ""Startup India"" in years to come. And the more both Indian and American entrepreneurs can share and learn from lessons about their own experiences, the more both ecosystems will benefit."
https://startuptalky.com/shark-tank-india-impact-startup-ecosystem/,"The Indian startup ecosystem has experienced significant growth, driven by a surge in entrepreneurial activities, increased access to venture capital, and a burgeoning culture of innovation. One of the factors contributing to this evolution is the emergence of television shows like Shark Tank India, an Indian adaptation of the popular American reality TV show Shark Tank which has become a prominent platform for entrepreneurs to showcase their innovative ideas, seek investments, and gain exposure to a wide audience.

Future Aspects Words like startups, stake dilution, seed funding, and ROIs have become common topics of day-to-day drawing room discussions after the Shark Tank India Season 1 was broadcasted in 2021. Commoners and the Indian middle class have become more interested in discussing the pros and cons of running a startup, coming up with new ideas, ownership, and entrepreneurship has become a dream come true. Gone are the days when kids or collegians used to hesitate to discuss their minds about opening their enterprise. I can talk of myself, my 4-year-old son aims to sell (wholesale) ration like dal, rice, and millets after being in touch with a few uncles who have started their venture of selling fully organic grocery, food grains, pulses, and millets. I will not say that it is directly because of Shark Tank India, I would say it is a ripple effect. His uncles have taken inspiration from the varied episodes of the reality show running on prime time at 9 pm on Sony Liv. The mindset of middle-class income groups has slowly evolved and they are open to the idea of owning an enterprise or business of their own. Thanks to television, OTT platforms, rapidly evolving social media, and brand publicity of a platform called ‘SHARK TANK INDIA’ that has made its space in every drawing room. The show that invites applications from the whole country has helped people feel the media and its power. Shark Tank India episodes have significantly boosted the visibility of startups by showcasing their products, services, commodities, and supplies to a more than 140 crore audience within India. This exposure has immensely helped firms, SMEs, potential investors, customers, and partners. The show has not only opened a gateway for increased visibility, it has opened a vast arena for investments, mutual cooperation, and development for the entire business community throughout the world. One can get orders, deals, and new credit lines after an entrepreneur’s story has been aired on a national TV channel. Thanks to the National Democratic Alliance-led Indian government which has shown the dream of ‘Startup India’ to the whole world. The Narendra Modi-led government has helped streamline policies, rules, and regulations to invite more and more investments in the small-scale sector. Indian government held hands with entrepreneurs in the way of Startup India, Digital India, Make in India, and many more such programs. Today, India has 3rd largest startup ecosystem in the world, and it is expected to witness year-on-year (YoY) growth of 12-15% consistent annual growth. The show promotes secure investments from successful and experienced investors so-called Sharks, who have dealt with the know-how of beginning a venture, taking required approvals, complying with the norms, and facing all the obstacles during their entrepreneurial journey.  Their insights, experiences, advice, and unbiased feedback can be very valuable in shaping the direction of upcoming enterprises. The stories of Sharks rather successful investors or businessmen/businesswomen cite a wonderful example for the decades to come and the upcoming generation who will be witnessing the ‘Amrit Kaal’ an auspicious period of 25 years between India’s 75th and 100th independence anniversaries. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has also signified the same and gave enough emphasis on funding for startups by announcing a corpus fund of Rs 1 lakh crore for the country’s tech-savvy youth in her Budget Speech on February 1. The injection of funds is crucial for a startup's growth and development and would become a huge deterrent if the demands of the business are not met. The show has given enough room for commoners to unhesitatingly pitch for funding on a social platform irrespective of the repercussions involved. The show has given the power to a hard-working entrepreneur to dream big, aim high, and be persistent in their effort to boost the company’s operations and focus on profitability regardless of enough funding at home.  There have been 320 pitches across two seasons of the show. The show’s third season has just aired on January 22. Sharks have invested Rs 128 crore in 176 of 320 startups, of which one-third went to food and beverage companies and personal care products. The categories featured on the show tend to reflect emerging trends in the Indian space, such as eCommerce, food and beverage, health and wellness, and education. The reality show, inspired by its US counterpart, has helped budding businessmen to start a new narrative of being prudent, and gutsy enough to present their business ideas and seeking investment from a panel of seasoned investors or 'sharks.'  This may contribute to a more vibrant economy, startup ecosystem, and healthy work culture in India. If most of the young minds think for their venture wherever necessary, just imagine what would happen.  With too much supply of 'startups', the competition would rise.  Every household will have one entrepreneur just like India has one engineer in every household. Winning in the startup ecosystem would become tougher and tougher with time. And, people will start dropping off once the market finds an equilibrium.  At the same time, it may be dangerous to have so many business houses, what would the private sector do? I am sure that everyone will have their niche, uniqueness, and brand supremacy that will help them thrive and sustain in the ever-evolving, technologically-equipped market. The presence of an innovator or an upcoming CEO in the show can serve as a market validation. Maybe just by being in the show, or securing investments on the Shark Tank platform, one can gain enough traction, confidence of customers, flashy deals, and attractive offerings, which the entrepreneur might have not even thought of. The entrepreneurs featured or participants on Shark Tank India will gain access to media, different networks, and websites where they can generously promote their products and supplies. A network of successful entrepreneurs, investors, and mentors would be keen to join hands with the budding entrepreneurs. This network would not only provide ongoing support, guidance, and connections but also threads that will be tied beyond the show as well. Shark Tank India Season 4 has been launched on 6th January 2025. A post shared by Shark Tank India (@sharktank.india) The success rate of any startup funding would depend on how true and reliable are the people (sharks) who are emerging as judges on the show. One may be very sweet and welcoming on television but may be very different in actual behavior and vice versa. What is shown on the screen may not be the entire truth of Shark Tank India. The stories, experiences, and personal behaviors matter a lot when it comes to running a successful show. A lot of participants have not talked about behind-the-scenes stories of Shark Tank India. It won’t be a surprise if tomorrow someone comes up and says that he/she was not paid a penny, which was promised on air. There have been stories in the media where participants have complained of not receiving the promised share from many sharks. In the latest Season of Shark Tank India, the sharks are exploring extra safeguards for their equity stakes by considering royalties based on sales. In the last two seasons of the reality show, where startups seek investments from experienced entrepreneurs, two kinds of deals were on the table—equity-based and debt-based. The latest add-on --royalty––is the fresh ingredient incorporated to enhance the overall flavor of the deal, making the culinary experience even more appetizing. One can say that these are prosperous times for sharks but challenging times for entrepreneurs. In the previous two seasons, no shark invested more than 10% of their net worth. One in five deals involved debt to keep the money secure. To avoid risks, the sharks largely remain restricted to their domain expertise. While the initial pitch on the show may create excitement and interest, the due diligence process that occurred afterward often revealed more about the companies, sometimes the sharks pulled back from their initial offers. There may be a case that sharks who are posing as judges, and their firms, may not be doing very well in terms of finances. Their own companies may be making losses, have overvaluation, or have not been earning enough profits. Still, their identity as a shark is undeterred, their business acumen, innovative ideas, intelligence, and vision can’t be questioned.  It's essential to note that the impact of Shark Tank India on the startup ecosystem will depend on various factors, including the success stories that emerge from the show, the strategies employed by the entrepreneurs post-investment by sharks, market policies, and the overall economic and business climate within the country.  Shark Tank India is a business reality show where entrepreneurs pitch ideas to investors for funding.
