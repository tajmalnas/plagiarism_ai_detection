I asked this question because I've seen both sides of the coin and wanted to share my perspective. On one hand, the energy and innovation in the startup ecosystem are absolutely electrifying. There's a sense of purpose and urgency that you don't often find in more traditional workplaces. But this comes at a cost. The long hours, the constant pressure to perform, and the expectation to be available around the clock can be overwhelming. I've seen colleagues burn out, relationships strain, and health deteriorate because of the relentless pace. In my own experience, I've had days where I barely saw my family, missed out on social events, and even neglected my own well-being just to meet deadlines or push a product out the door. The hustle culture is glorified to the point where taking a break feels like a weakness. It's almost like if you're not working 12-14 hours a day, you're not contributing enough. But it's not all bad imo. There are startups that are trying to change this narrative by promoting a healthier work-life balance, offering flexible hours, and encouraging employees to take time off. However, these are still in the minority. The prevailing mindset is still very much ""work hard, play hard,"" but the ""play"" part often gets sidelined. So, in my opinion, while the startup culture in India is driving incredible innovation and growth, it's also creating an environment where work-life balance is often sacrificed. It's a double-edged sword, and finding that balance is something that both employers and employees need to work on actively. Ask a question on Grapevine. Take the damn day off man!

Better ""I will be taking leave"" Next day: hi you're fired First learn to request or demand a leave, then go about lecturing people on startups and culture. I wonder what work can ever be done on a WFH day while traveling tourist hotspots that also happens to be a bday trip. 😂😂😂 Startups or otherwise - when you work,you work. When you're on leave, you delegate. You don't go half-assing about WFH for a bday trip in the mountains. Absolute dumbfuckery and stupidest post ever. Lol that's a bit harsh. I agree it should just be a leave, but still itna harsh... Now I am scared, next year from July I will be on probation for 3 months and will have my convocation in that time I wish I get it off July tho bahut door ki baat hai.... No need to be scared if you're planning to let your manager know within the week of joining.

https://qz.com/india/1222311/the-dark-underbelly-of-indias-glamourous-startup-ecosystem,"Cersei Lannister. That’s what her team calls the 33-year-old co-founder of a Bengaluru-based startup behind her back. The Game of Thrones reference—Lannister is a cutthroat empress in the series—came about last year after she sacked a newly-hired marketing head on the spot following a difference of opinion during a meeting. The manager had joined the five-year-old startup with much pomp, having spent over 15 years at multiple big multi-national companies (MNCs). The firing was not a first at the startup, though, according to at least two current employees and a former one who spoke to Quartz of the firm’s many dictatorial policies. At another Bengaluru-based business-to-consumer startup, employees have been prohibited from using the table tennis equipment during office hours. The founder felt the staff was spending way too much time playing. ”We can use it post-9pm only. Who’s going to stay back so late in the night to play?” an employee asked, requesting anonymity. “Now the table just stands in a corner gathering dust. When outsiders visit the office, they look at it and think we have a great culture in the office. But we know the reality.” Indeed, behind the gloss and glamour of India’s booming startup ecosystem lies such an ugly truth: From unrealistic expectations, job insecurity, and constantly shifting goal posts to a lack of scope for growth, the reality of working at an Indian startup is far from fun. With young companies now increasingly pivoting their businesses or bringing in investors who suggest significant changes, employees are the ones left unsettled the most. Starting off on a quest for great ideas, the sector is now all about execution, revenue, and profit—and work culture is taking a backseat. “Chaos is what defines a startup,” said Vidur Gupta, director of staffing firm Spectrum Talent Management. With the",300,17,5.193333333333333,60.85,0.6534307520882326
https://qz.com/india/1222311/the-dark-underbelly-of-indias-glamourous-startup-ecosystem,"euphoria of the initial years waning and reality sinking in of late, it has become harder for young companies across the globe to raise funds. Investors are stressing on revenue generation and profitability like never before, and startups are under pressure to make money more than anything else. So entrepreneurs have shifted from risk-taking innovations to sales. “India has been a startup hub for some years now and products are now out in the market. Now, the startup has to show market share and delivery. That’s what the promoters’ ask has been,” said Mayur Saraswat, head of sales at staffing firm TeamLease Services. This shift has not gone down too well with employees, who joined with hopes of a back-slapping, dress-code free informal ambiance. “It’s a sweatshop in there. You are not allowed to take tea breaks for more than 10 minutes,” a former employee of the Bengaluru firm mentioned above said, requesting anonymity. “If you take a third tea break in a day, ‘Cersei ‘ will pass a nasty comment in front of everyone. The co-founders sometimes even stand next to employees’ desks just to hear their conversations and check what windows are open on their computers.” Past and present employees of other startups, too, lament similar restrictions and work cultures. The often inexperienced entrepreneurs have failed to create a culture in their teams. And with these teams growing, this has become a very prominent problem. At least 10 startup employees from across the country described their experience to Quartz as “chaotic” and “messy.” They felt stifled at work and were desperate for alternative opportunities, preferably at a traditional MNC. “I have sworn to never work with another startup,” a 33-year-old marketing professional who quit another Bengaluru firm due to “a hostile work environment,” told Quartz. “I have been",300,18,5.153333333333333,63.09,0.6301158292463565

I could have easily found one at a startup by now. But I am more happy waiting it out rather than going back to that rut.” In small teams, most employees are expected to do jobs beyond what is specified on paper. This implies working extra hours and effort for the same salary. “The roles and responsibilities don’t get defined very well. The way performance is measured isn’t clearly defined,” said Aditya Narayan Mishra, CEO of Bengaluru-based human resources company CIEL HR Services. “Maybe an employee is a specialist and you try to make that person a generalist. It doesn’t work all the time” It is, of course, a given that entry-level professionals suffer under such circumstances. But even at the middle and top, though, serious hierarchical conflicts come into play. After all, the ecosystem has attracted hundreds of professionals from legacy industries like retail, consumer goods, insurance, and banking over the past decade. These professionals left behind cushy jobs, hoping to create instant wealth through stock options, seek more challenging roles, and to build solutions from the ground-up. But this shift itself has now become the premise of conflict. For instance, in smaller teams, the highly experienced professionals often have inexperienced bosses. And the seniors are often simply unable to adjust. “The disconnect is that a lot of these people who work in startups have previously worked with large multinationals (where) the processes are clearly defined,” said Gupta of Spectrum Talent Management. Whereas, in addition to an ambiguous work structure at startups, employees also have to handle multiple roles and stomach considerably higher pressure, he added. The tension also heightens when a founder’s passion is in conflict with a professional’s knowledge and experience.”There are",300,19,5.326666666666667,54.52,0.6777596848373915

The post, which has since gained significant attention, reveals the harrowing experience of an employee who faced humiliation and was reduced to tears during a Google Meet session. Also Read: “UK Salaries Are a Joke”: UK Professor Says India Pays Better, Sparks Debate The employee accused one of the company’s co-founders, who also acts as the tech lead, of regular verbal abuse. The techie detailed how the mistreatment left him emotionally overwhelmed. “I cried on Google Meet in front of the tech lead. I do not know how to face it now,” the title of the post read. In his account, the Redditor explained that the startup environment required employees to endure 12-15-hour shifts without adequate guidance or training. During one particular meeting, when the employee pointed out the lack of clear instructions for a project, he was met with harsh words and humiliation. “I couldn’t hold my tears and started crying. I was not in the mental zone to work, so I told him I’m taking leave after a few hours,” he shared.

Many highlighted that such behavior from leadership often worsens over time and recommended leaving the company for a more respectful workplace. One veteran employer noted, “The day your manager disrespects you should be your last ‘mentally engaged’ day at that company. Respect and dignity are non-negotiable.” Broader ImplicationsThis incident has reignited conversations about work culture in Indian startups, with many urging for better regulations and accountability to protect employees’ well-being.

According to the Global Startup Ecosystem Index 2024, the city has over 650 startups, representing 6% of the country’s startups and is the 4th best startup ecosystem in the country. However, despite its widely-recognised reputation as a city that promotes and facilitates the establishment of new ventures cutting across fields as well as welcomes ambitious job seekers from across the country, young employees in the city report various structural issues such as job insecurity, excessive workload, unstable and dysfunctional work ethic, perfunctory grievance redressal systems and overall ‘toxicity’ prevailing over the workspace.

It cost me a lakh to recover the data and repair my device without any assistance from the company. Despite all of this, I was laid off within four months for no specified reason. I have still not been given a month’s pay while working overtime almost every day. The company refuses to communicate and settle the matter,” he told The Hindu. Brane Enterprises, a tech startup in Hi-Tec City, which has links to Byrraju Ramalinga Raju, the main accused in the Satyam Computers scandal and lists his son Byrraju Rama Raju and other family members as shareholders, recently laid off more than 1,500 employees and has not cleared salaries up to 4 months. “I joined the company on May 6 this year and was laid off within 4 months on August 3.

While long and strenuous work hours, sporadic hiring and firing, and freezing of salaries in emerging companies are oft-overlooked and whitewashed as ‘hustle culture’, employees also highlight the lack of grievance redressal systems in startups. “I personally experienced and saw various other women colleagues routinely tolerating body shaming, mocking, and derogatory remarks at a fashion startup based in Jubilee Hills. A male manager used to unabashedly comment on my weight and physical appearance and invade my personal space,” said 25-year-old Sindhu Vaishnavi, who was compelled to leave the job within 3 months of joining. Under the POSH Act, 2013, every organisation with 10 or more employees must establish an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) to tackle complaints of sexual harassment and institute redressal policies. “I complained to the HR and senior manager but they did not take any action. There was no regulatory body where I could lodge a complaint. This culture is so pervasive across fashion startups that reform is a faraway fantasy. It is not only detrimental to one’s mental wellbeing but compels young girls with big dreams to exit the industry moments after stepping into it,” she highlights. Similarly, Piyali Chakraborty of Nallakunta, who resigned from an ed-tech startup within 2 months of her tenure, highlights the extent of verbal and emotional abuse an employee faces for voicing their concerns and demanding reform. “I had to arrive by 8:30 a.m. with work stretching until 10 p.m.. The office lacked proper seating, air conditioning, and basic amenities like a cafeteria or refrigerator. Shockingly, we didn’t even have computers; all tasks were done manually.

I was forced to take up extra work in exchange for my documents and had to forfeit a month’s salary,” she added. The recent death of a 26-year-old Chartered Accountant Anna Sebastian Perayil, who worked at Ernst & Young (EY) in Pune, allegedly owing to extreme work pressure, has brought to the forefront conversations about fostering healthier work cultures. Upon being asked about long-term solutions to the prevailing work culture across the city, Anita Rego, a Hyderabad-based psychiatric social worker observes: “Victim blaming can become counterproductive and result in job resignations and increased employee health concerns. There is a tendency to shift the narrative onto the individual who is under stress. Workplace toxicity is an organisational issue and thus, the systemic issues at the organisation need to be resolved.” Ms. Rego, who is the curator of a two-year programme called ‘Tuning into Empathetic Leadership’, supporting a group of production companies to reduce bullying, harassment and grievances at the workplace, emphasises that healthier workplaces and happier manpower contribute to better productivity and profits, while urging companies to initiate employee support programmes.

The numbers are telling - from 3,100 startups in 2014 to a projection of more than 11,500 by 2022, this is certainly not a passing trend. It’s a revolution. And it’s going to change the way the markets are working today in India. India, thereby inevitably proves to be a popular eco-system for any start-up to find its prominence. Although the success rate of startups has always dimmed low in India. Reasons’ being plenty, the most commonly repeated mistake is the unapologetic nature of Indian young entrepreneurs trying to adopt or rather imitate the business culture or corporate culture prevalent in the western nations. Now the failure rate of the startups has much to do with the strategy and decisions incorporated by the founder or the CEOs of the company.There are many organizational theories as to what a start-up should refer before starting its operations. 80% of its compliance depends upon its founder, which can be supposedly established among its first 20 employees. But things start getting diverse when there are more than 50 employees in a start-up.

Dear Readers, Startups are often hailed as the engines of innovation and economic growth, but beneath the glamour lies a pressing issue: many Indian startups struggle to sustain a healthy workplace culture. This newsletter delves into the reasons behind this challenge, supported by detailed statistics and insights. India is home to over 84,000 registered startups as of 2023, with the ecosystem valued at over $450 billion. However, cultural challenges within these startups paint a stark picture: 70% of employees in Indian startups report experiencing burnout, according to a 2022 Nasscom survey. 55% feel a lack of career development opportunities, highlighting a gap in long-term growth planning. 45% cite poor work-life balance as a significant issue, as revealed by an EY study on workplace dynamics. Only 30% of startup employees feel their organizations provide adequate mental health support, according to a survey by LinkedIn India. Startups often prioritize rapid scaling and revenue generation, sidelining employee well-being. A McKinsey report found that 85% of Indian startups prioritize market capture over organizational health, leading to overworked teams. Founders, often young and first-time entrepreneurs, lack managerial expertise. A KPMG study noted that 60% of startup leaders have no prior experience managing teams, resulting in poor communication and unclear expectations. HR functions are often underfunded or underdeveloped. 42% of startups have no formal grievance redressal mechanisms, according to a Deloitte survey. Unrealistic KPIs foster internal competition rather than collaboration. A Harvard Business Review article highlights that 63% of Indian startup employees feel undervalued in their roles, contributing to dissatisfaction.
