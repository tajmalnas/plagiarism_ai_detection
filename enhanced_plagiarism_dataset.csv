https://grapevine.in/post/is-indias-startup-culture-harming-work-life-balance-6a1bb37e-d9fe-4084-961a-f16f159b2261,"I can say that the startup culture in India is too toxic and is definitely impacting work-life balance, and not always in a good way. I asked this question because I've seen both sides of the coin and wanted to share my perspective. On one hand, the energy and innovation in the startup ecosystem are absolutely electrifying. There's a sense of purpose and urgency that you don't often find in more traditional workplaces. But this comes at a cost. The long hours, the constant pressure to perform, and the expectation to be available around the clock can be overwhelming. I've seen colleagues burn out, relationships strain, and health deteriorate because of the relentless pace. In my own experience, I've had days where I barely saw my family, missed out on social events, and even neglected my own well-being just to meet deadlines or push a product out the door. The hustle culture is glorified to the point where taking a break feels like a weakness. It's almost like if you're not working 12-14 hours a day, you're not contributing enough. But it's not all bad imo. There are startups that are trying to change this narrative by promoting a healthier work-life balance, offering flexible hours, and encouraging employees to take time off. However, these are still in the minority. The prevailing mindset is still very much ""work hard, play hard,"" but the ""play"" part often gets sidelined. So, in my opinion, while the startup culture in India is driving incredible innovation and growth, it's also creating an environment where work-life balance is often sacrificed. It's a double-edged sword, and finding that balance is something that both employers and employees need to work on actively. Ask a question on Grapevine. Take the damn day off man! ""Hey, My cousins are here for a trip. I will be working remotely tomorrow. Thanks."" Better ""I will be taking leave"" Next day: hi you're fired First learn to request or demand a leave, then go about lecturing people on startups and culture. I wonder what work can ever be done on a WFH day while traveling tourist hotspots that also happens to be a bday trip. 😂😂😂 Startups or otherwise -  when you work,you work. When you're on leave, you delegate. You don't go half-assing about WFH for a bday trip in the mountains. Absolute dumbfuckery and stupidest post ever. Lol that's a bit harsh. I agree it should just be a leave, but still itna harsh... Now I am scared, next year from July I will be on probation for 3 months and will have my convocation in that time I wish I get it off July tho bahut door ki baat hai.... No need to be scared if you're planning to let your manager know within the week of joining. You'll lose quite a bit of trust if you tell them a couple of days before the convocation though don't read the message just send People like this should take the damn leave. Clearly dikh rha h ki kaam to k nhi. To kyu naam k liye wfh chaiye. Problem with Indian employees is that they lack integrity and a sense of pride. Then they cry online about not getting what they want. How is it harming and how can you say it's a startup ...",554,44,4.593862815884476,72.87,0.4774424472935544
https://qz.com/india/1222311/the-dark-underbelly-of-indias-glamourous-startup-ecosystem,"Cersei Lannister. That’s what her team calls the 33-year-old co-founder of a Bengaluru-based startup behind her back. The Game of Thrones reference—Lannister is a cutthroat empress in the series—came about last year after she sacked a newly-hired marketing head on the spot following a difference of opinion during a meeting. The manager had joined the five-year-old startup with much pomp, having spent over 15 years at multiple big multi-national companies (MNCs). The firing was not a first at the startup, though, according to at least two current employees and a former one who spoke to Quartz of the firm’s many dictatorial policies. At another Bengaluru-based business-to-consumer startup, employees have been prohibited from using the table tennis equipment during office hours. The founder felt the staff was spending way too much time playing. ”We can use it post-9pm only. Who’s going to stay back so late in the night to play?” an employee asked, requesting anonymity. “Now the table just stands in a corner gathering dust. When outsiders visit the office, they look at it and think we have a great culture in the office. But we know the reality.” Indeed, behind the gloss and glamour of India’s booming startup ecosystem lies such an ugly truth: From unrealistic expectations, job insecurity, and constantly shifting goal posts to a lack of scope for growth, the reality of working at an Indian startup is far from fun. With young companies now increasingly pivoting their businesses or bringing in investors who suggest significant changes, employees are the ones left unsettled the most. Starting off on a quest for great ideas, the sector is now all about execution, revenue, and profit—and work culture is taking a backseat. “Chaos is what defines a startup,” said Vidur Gupta, director of staffing firm Spectrum Talent Management. With the euphoria of the initial years waning and reality sinking in of late, it has become harder for young companies across the globe to raise funds. Investors are stressing on revenue generation and profitability like never before, and startups are under pressure to make money more than anything else. So entrepreneurs have shifted from risk-taking innovations to sales. “India has been a startup hub for some years now and products are now out in the market. Now, the startup has to show market share and delivery. That’s what the promoters’ ask has been,” said Mayur Saraswat, head of sales at staffing firm TeamLease Services. This shift has not gone down too well with employees, who joined with hopes of a back-slapping, dress-code free informal ambiance. “It’s a sweatshop in there. You are not allowed to take tea breaks for more than 10 minutes,” a former employee of the Bengaluru firm mentioned above said, requesting anonymity. “If you take a third tea break in a day, ‘Cersei ‘ will pass a nasty comment in front of everyone. The co-founders sometimes even stand next to employees’ desks just to hear their conversations and check what windows are open on their computers.” Past and present employees of other startups, too, lament similar restrictions and work cultures. The often inexperienced entrepreneurs have failed to create a culture in their teams. And with these teams growing, this has become a very prominent problem. At least 10 startup employees from across the country described their experience to Quartz as “chaotic” and “messy.” They felt stifled at work and were desperate for alternative opportunities, preferably at a traditional MNC. “I have sworn to never work with another startup,” a 33-year-old marketing professional who quit another Bengaluru firm due to “a hostile work environment,” told Quartz. “I have been sitting at home for the last five months and looking for jobs with bigger companies. I could have easily found one at a startup by now. But I am more happy waiting it out rather than going back to that rut.” In small teams, most employees are expected to do jobs beyond what is specified on paper. This implies working extra hours and effort for the same salary. “The roles and responsibilities don’t get defined very well. The way performance is measured isn’t clearly defined,” said Aditya Narayan Mishra, CEO of Bengaluru-based human resources company CIEL HR Services. “Maybe an employee is a specialist and you try to make that person a generalist. It doesn’t work all the time” It is, of course, a given that entry-level professionals suffer under such circumstances. But even at the middle and top, though, serious hierarchical conflicts come into play. After all, the ecosystem has attracted hundreds of professionals from legacy industries like retail, consumer goods, insurance, and banking over the past decade. These professionals left behind cushy jobs, hoping to create instant wealth through stock options, seek more challenging roles, and to build solutions from the ground-up. But this shift itself has now become the premise of conflict. For instance, in smaller teams, the highly experienced professionals often have inexperienced bosses. And the seniors are often simply unable to adjust. “The disconnect is that a lot of these people who work in startups have previously worked with large multinationals (where) the processes are clearly defined,” said Gupta of Spectrum Talent Management. Whereas, in addition to an ambiguous work structure at startups, employees also have to handle multiple roles and stomach considerably higher pressure, he added. The tension also heightens when a founder’s passion is in conflict with a professional’s knowledge and experience.”There are some startups which are backed by big investors because of the power of the idea. But the management is not experienced,” said Mishra of CIEL HR Services. Such conflicts have already added to a serious attrition problem for Indian startups and may make it hard for the sector to attract talent in the future.

I've been part of the startup ecosystem for a few years now, and while it's exciting and full of opportunities, it's also incredibly demanding. The pressure to perform, the long hours, and the constant hustle can be overwhelming. In many startups, there's this unspoken expectation that you have to be available 24/7. The work-life balance is almost non-existent. I remember days when I would work late into the night, only to wake up early the next morning to do it all over again. Weekends? Forget about it. They often become just another workday. This kind of environment can quickly lead to burnout. Moreover, there's a special kind of stress that comes with the uncertainty and instability of startups. You're always on edge, wondering if the company will survive the next funding round or if your job is secure. This constant state of anxiety can take a serious toll on your mental health. Another issue is the glorification of the ""hustle culture."" There's this idea that if you're not working yourself to the bone, you're not doing enough. It's almost like a badge of honor to be exhausted and overworked. But in reality, it's not sustainable. People burn out, and when they do, it affects not just their professional life but their personal life as well. I've seen colleagues who were once passionate and enthusiastic become disillusioned and drained. Some have even left the industry altogether because they couldn't handle the pressure anymore. It's a real problem that needs to be addressed. I agree with this. I have only worked for 1.5 years at a startup but I have realised that wlb is very crucial too and I have been considering that since I understood how my health is getting affected.

The post, which has since gained significant attention, reveals the harrowing experience of an employee who faced humiliation and was reduced to tears during a Google Meet session. Also Read: “UK Salaries Are a Joke”: UK Professor Says India Pays Better, Sparks Debate The employee accused one of the company’s co-founders, who also acts as the tech lead, of regular verbal abuse. The techie detailed how the mistreatment left him emotionally overwhelmed. “I cried on Google Meet in front of the tech lead. I do not know how to face it now,” the title of the post read. In his account, the Redditor explained that the startup environment required employees to endure 12-15-hour shifts without adequate guidance or training. During one particular meeting, when the employee pointed out the lack of clear instructions for a project, he was met with harsh words and humiliation. “I couldn’t hold my tears and started crying. I was not in the mental zone to work, so I told him I’m taking leave after a few hours,” he shared.

One commenter suggested switching to established companies or freelancing to escape such toxic cultures. Community Support for the TechieThe Reddit community was quick to provide solace, urging the employee to prioritize mental health and find a healthier work environment. Many highlighted that such behavior from leadership often worsens over time and recommended leaving the company for a more respectful workplace. One veteran employer noted, “The day your manager disrespects you should be your last ‘mentally engaged’ day at that company. Respect and dignity are non-negotiable.” Broader ImplicationsThis incident has reignited conversations about work culture in Indian startups, with many urging for better regulations and accountability to protect employees’ well-being. Toxic work environments not only harm individual employees but also undermine the potential for innovation and growth within the organization.

     Dear Readers, Startups are often hailed as the engines of innovation and economic growth, but beneath the glamour lies a pressing issue: many Indian startups struggle to sustain a healthy workplace culture. This newsletter delves into the reasons behind this challenge, supported by detailed statistics and insights. India is home to over 84,000 registered startups as of 2023, with the ecosystem valued at over $450 billion. However, cultural challenges within these startups paint a stark picture: 70% of employees in Indian startups report experiencing burnout, according to a 2022 Nasscom survey. 55% feel a lack of career development opportunities, highlighting a gap in long-term growth planning. 45% cite poor work-life balance as a significant issue, as revealed by an EY study on workplace dynamics. Only 30% of startup employees feel their organizations provide adequate mental health support, according to a survey by LinkedIn India. Startups often prioritize rapid scaling and revenue generation, sidelining employee well-being. A McKinsey report found that 85% of Indian startups prioritize market capture over organizational health, leading to overworked teams. Founders, often young and first-time entrepreneurs, lack managerial expertise. A KPMG study noted that 60% of startup leaders have no prior experience managing teams, resulting in poor communication and unclear expectations. HR functions are often underfunded or underdeveloped. 42% of startups have no formal grievance redressal mechanisms, according to a Deloitte survey. Unrealistic KPIs foster internal competition rather than collaboration. A Harvard Business Review article highlights that 63% of Indian startup employees feel undervalued in their roles, contributing to dissatisfaction. Compensation packages often emphasize stock options over competitive salaries. 48% of employees feel financially insecure, as per a PwC report, citing delayed ROI on equity-based pay. The average attrition rate in Indian startups is 30-40%, compared to the global average of 20%. A 2023 report by TeamLease Services found that 57% of employees leave within two years, citing burnout and lack of growth. Disengaged employees cost companies 34% of their salary in lost productivity, according to Gallup. Startups with low employee satisfaction see up to a 25% dip in productivity, as per an Assocham study. Poor reviews on platforms like Glassdoor deter top talent. 78% of prospective employees check online reviews, and 40% decline offers due to negative feedback, according to a survey by Indeed. Invest in training founders and managers in people management and emotional intelligence. Companies that prioritize leadership training see a 15% increase in employee retention, as per a study by Korn Ferry. Implement mental health programs, flexible working hours, and initiatives to prevent burnout. Organizations with robust well-being programs report a 21% increase in employee satisfaction, according to the World Economic Forum. Encourage open dialogue about challenges and achievements to build trust. Transparency can reduce turnover by 18%, as shown in a Glassdoor report. Develop robust policies for career growth, grievance handling, and workplace ethics. Startups with strong HR policies experience a 32% lower attrition rate, as per Deloitte. Balance financial goals with employee satisfaction metrics to create a sustainable growth model. Companies that incorporate employee satisfaction into KPIs see a 20% boost in overall performance, according to McKinsey.    The Indian startup ecosystem holds immense potential, but its true success lies in fostering a culture where employees thrive alongside the business. Addressing these challenges with data-driven strategies can transform workplaces into hubs of innovation and satisfaction. What are your thoughts on this issue? Let us know!
